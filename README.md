# Surfs Up

## Overview
### Purpose

After completing our initial analysis to be presented to investors, W. Avy came back to us wanting more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wanted temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business could be sustainable year-round. We executed two more queries on the sqlite database to check on the trends at the hottest and coldest times of the year.

## Results
### June and December Temperature Differences

Three key differences of the temperatures in June and December are as follows:
- While the months of June and December have similar max temperatures of 85 and 83 degrees, it can get as cold as 56 degrees in December.
- The month of June is at least 73 degrees or hotter 75% of the time, while that threshold decreases to 69 degrees or hotter 75% of the time in December. 25% of the time is can actually get colder than 69 degrees.
- On average, the month of December is at least 3 degrees colder than the month of June.

## Summary
### Other Queries
While these differences may give us pause to have the shop open year-round, the data also shows the average temperature remains above 70 in either June or December. Through this we can infer that on average the coldest temperature on Oahu is 71 degrees, meaning the shop could see business year-round. While this information is promising, here are two other queries we could run to gather more weather data for the months in question:
